arXiv paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.8008

R package: https://github.com/tdhock/rankSVMcompare/

Reproducible results:

- To re-do computations from scratch, make sure to delete all figures
  and intermediate RData files, =rm -rf *.RData figure-*.tex=
- To re-make Figure 4 (percent incorrect test pairs versus number of
  training pairs, for three simulated data sets, and one sushi data
  set), execute =make figure-simulation-sushi-samples.tex=
