\begin{abstract}
  In ranking problems, the goal is to learn a ranking function
  $r(\mathbf x)\in\RR$ from labeled pairs $\mathbf x,\mathbf x'$ of
  input points. In this paper, we consider the related comparison
  problem, where the label $y\in\{-1,0,1\}$ indicates which element of
  the pair is better, or if there is no significant difference. We
  cast the learning problem as a margin maximization, and show that it
  can be solved by converting it to a standard SVM. We use simulated
  nonlinear patterns and a real learning to rank sushi data set to
  show that our proposed SVMcompare algorithm outperforms SVMrank when
  there are equality $y=0$ pairs.  In addition, we show that SVMcompare outperforms the ELO rating system when predicting the outcome of chess matches.

\section{Introduction}

In the supervised learning to rank problem \citep{learning-to-rank}, we are
given labeled pairs of items $\mathbf x,\mathbf x'$, where the label
$y\in\{-1,1\}$ indicates which item in the pair should be ranked
higher. The goal is to learn a ranking function $r(\mathbf x)\in\RR$
which outputs a real-valued rank for each item. In this paper we
consider a related problem in which the expanded label space
$y\in\{-1,0,1\}$ includes the $y=0$ label which indicates that there
should be no rank difference. In this context the goal is to learn a
comparison function $c(\mathbf x, \mathbf x')\in\{-1,0,1\}$.

Comparison data naturally arise from competitive two-player games in which
the space of possible outcomes includes a draw (neither player wins).
In games such as chess, draws are a common result between highly
skilled players. To accurately predict the outcome of such games, it
is thus important to learn a model that can predict a draw. 
% Features
% $\mathbf x_i,\mathbf x_i'$ for each player in a matchup could be
% generated from player statistics in these cases. 
% Comparison
% evaluation and ascertaining if enough describable difference exists in
% skill is important in determining outcomes in these cases.

Comparison data also result when considering subjective human
evaluations of pairs of items. For example, if each item is a movie, a
person might say that \textit{Les Mis\'erables} is better than
\textit{Star Wars}, and \textit{The Empire Strikes Back} is as good as
\textit{Star Wars}. Another example is rating food items such as
wine, in which a person may prefer one wine to another, but not be
able to perceive a difference between two other wines. In this
context, it is important to use a model which can predict no
difference between two items.
% Features $\mathbf x_i,\mathbf x_i'$ of the movies
% can be length in minutes, year of theatrical release, indicators for
% genre, actors/actresses, directors, etc.

More formally, assume
that we have a training sample of $n$ labeled pairs. For each pair
$i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$ we have input features $\mathbf x_i,\mathbf
x_i'\in\RR^p$ and a label $y_i\in\{-1,0,1\}$ that indicates which
element is better:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:z}
  y_i =
  \begin{cases}
    -1 &  r(\mathbf x_i)>r(\mathbf x_i')
    \text{, $\mathbf x_i$ is better than $\mathbf x'_i$},\\
    0 & r(\mathbf x_i) = r(\mathbf x_i')
    \text{, $\mathbf x_i$ is as good as $\mathbf x'_i$},\\
    1 & r(\mathbf x_i)<r(\mathbf x_i')
    \text{, $\mathbf x'_i$ is better than $\mathbf x_i$}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

These data are geometrically represented in the top panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:norm-data}. Pairs with equality labels $y_i=0$ are
represented as line segments, and pairs with inequality labels
$y_i=\{-1,1\}$ are represented as arrows pointing to the item with the
higher rank.

The goal of learning is to find a comparison function $c:\RR^p \times
\RR^p \rightarrow \{-1,0,1\}$ which generalizes to a test set of data,
as measured by the zero-one loss:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:min_c}
  \minimize_{c} 
  \sum_{i\in\text{test}}
  I\left[ c(\mathbf x_i, \mathbf x_i')\neq y_i \right],
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the indicator function. If there are no equality $y_i=0$
pairs, then this problem is equivalent to learning to rank with a
pairwise zero-one loss function \citep{learning-to-rank}. Learning to
rank has been extensively studied, resulting in state-of-the-art
algorithms such as SVMrank \citep{ranksvm}. However, we are interested
in learning to compare with equality $y_i=0$ pairs, which to our
knowledge has only been studied by \citet{rank-with-ties}. In this
article we propose SVMcompare, a support vector algorithm for these
data.

The notation and organization of this article is as follows. We use
bold uppercase letters for matrices such as $\mathbf X, \mathbf K$,
and bold lowercase letters for their row vectors $\mathbf x_i, \mathbf
k_i$. In Section~\ref{sec:related} we discuss links with related work
on classification and ranking, then in Section~\ref{sec:svm-compare}
we propose a new algorithm: SVMcompare. We show results on 3
illustrative simulated data sets and one real learning to rank sushi
data set in Section~\ref{sec:results}, then discuss future work in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\subsection{Comparison and ranking problems}

In ranking problems, each training example is a pair of
inputs/features $\mathbf x,\mathbf x'\in\RR^p$, and a corresponding
label/output $y_i\{-1,1\}$, which indicates which of the two inputs
should be ranked higher (Table~\ref{tab:related}). In the comparison
problem that we study in this paper, outputs $y\in\{-1,0,1\}$ include
the $y=0$ equality pairs or ties, which indicate that the two inputs
should be ranked equally.  The statistics literature contains many
probabilistic models for paired comparison experiments, some of which
directly model ties \citep{davidson-ties}. Such models are concerned
with accurately ranking a finite number of inputs $x\in\{1,\dots,t\}$,
so are not directly applicable to the real-valued inputs
$\mathbf x\in\RR^p$ we consider in this paper. 

The supervised learning to rank problem has been extensively studied
in the machine learning literature \citep{object-ranking-methods,
  learning-to-rank}, and is similar to the supervised comparison
problem we consider in this paper. There are several Bayesian models
which can be applied to learning to rank, such as TrueSkill
\citep{trueskill} and GLICKO \citep{GLICKO}, which are generalizations
of the Elo chess rating system. The SVMrank algorithm was
proposed for learning to rank \citep{ranksvm}, and the large-margin
learning formulation we propose in this article is similar. The
difference is that we also consider the case where both inputs are
judged to be equally good ($y_i=0$). A boosting algorithm for this
``ranking with ties'' problem was proposed by \citet{rank-with-ties},
who observed that modeling ties is more effective when there are more
output values.

\changed{Ranking data sets are often described not in terms of labeled
  pairs of inputs $(\mathbf x_i, \mathbf x_i', y_i)$ but instead
  single inputs $\mathbf x_i$ with ordinal labels
  $y_i\in\{1,\dots,k\}$, where $k$ is the number of integral output
  values. Support Vector Ordinal Regression \citep{ordinal} has a
  large-margin learning formulation specifically designed for these
  data. Another approach is to first convert the inputs to a database
  of labeled pairs, and then learn a ranking model such as the
  SVMcompare model we propose in this paper. \citet{sv-survival}
  observed that directly using a regression model gives better
  performance than ranking models for survival data. However, in this
  paper we limit our study to models for labeled pairs of inputs, and
  we focus on answering the question, ``how can we adapt the Support
  Vector Machine to exploit the structure of the equality $y_i=0$
  pairs when they are present?''}

% When the inputs are discrete $x_i,x_i'\in\{1,\dots,k\}$, then the
% problem is known as learning a relation \citep{relations}. In this
% article we consider the case when inputs are real-valued vectors

\subsection{SVMrank for comparing}
\label{sec:svmrank}
In this section we explain how to apply the existing SVMrank algorithm
to a comparison data set.  The goal of SVMrank is to learn a ranking
function $r:\RR^p \rightarrow \RR$. When $r(\mathbf x)=\mathbf
w^\intercal \mathbf x$ is linear, the primal problem for some cost
parameter $C\in\RR^+$ is the following quadratic program (QP):
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \minimize_{\mathbf w, \mathbf \xi}\ \ & \frac 1 2
    \mathbf w^\intercal \mathbf w
    + C \sum_{i\in \mathcal I_1\cup \mathcal I_{-1}} \xi_i \\
    \text{subject to}\ \ &
    \forall i\in \mathcal I_1\cup \mathcal I_{-1},\ \xi_i \geq 0,\\
    & \text{and }\xi_i \geq 1-\mathbf w^\intercal(\mathbf x_i'-\mathbf
    x_i)y_i,
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:svmrank}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal I_y=\{i\mid y_i=y\}$ are the sets of indices for the different
labels. Note that (\ref{eq:svmrank}) is the same as Optimization
Problem 1 (Ranking SVM), in the paper of \citet{ranksvm}. Note also
that the equality $y_i=0$ pairs are not used in the optimization
problem.

After obtaining a weight vector $\mathbf w\in\RR^p$ by solving SVMrank
(\ref{eq:svmrank}), we get a ranking function $r(\mathbf x)\in\RR$,
but we are not yet able to predict equality $y_i=0$ pairs. To do so,
we extend SVMrank by defining a threshold $\tau\in\RR^+$ and a
thresholding function $t_\tau:\RR\rightarrow\{-1,0,1\}$
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:threshold}
  t_\tau(x) = 
  \begin{cases}
    -1 & \text{ if } x < -\tau, \\
    0 & \text{ if } |x| \leq \tau, \\
    1 & \text{ if } x > \tau. \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
A comparison function $c_\tau:\RR^p\times \RR^p\rightarrow \{-1, 0,
1\}$ is defined as the thresholded difference of predicted ranks
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:compare_general}
  c_\tau(\mathbf x, \mathbf x') = 
  t_\tau\big(
  r(\mathbf x') - r(\mathbf x)
  \big).
\end{equation}
We can then use grid search to estimate an optimal threshold $\hat
\tau$, by minimizing the zero-one loss with respect to all the
training pairs:
\begin{equation}
  \hat \tau = \argmin_{\tau}
  \sum_{i=1}^n
  I\left[ c_\tau(\mathbf x_i, \mathbf x_i') \neq y_i \right].
\end{equation}
However, there are two potential problems with the learned comparison
function $c_{\hat\tau}$. First, the equality pairs $i\in \mathcal I_0$ are not
used to learn the weight vector $\mathbf w$ in (\ref{eq:svmrank}). Second, the
threshold $\hat \tau$ is learned in a separate optimization step,
which may be suboptimal. In the next section, we propose a new
algorithm that fixes these issues by directly using all the
training pairs in a single learning problem.

  \label{fig:hard-margin}
\end{figure*}

In this section we discuss new learning algorithms for comparison
problems. In all cases, we will first learn a ranking function
$r:\RR^p\rightarrow\RR$ and then a comparison function
$c_1:\RR^p\times \RR^p\rightarrow\{-1,0,1\}$
(\ref{eq:compare_general}). In other words, a small rank difference
$|r(\mathbf x')-r(\mathbf x)|\leq 1$ is considered insignificant, and
there are two decision boundaries $r(\mathbf x')-r(\mathbf
x)\in\{-1,1\}$.

\subsection{LP and QP for separable data}
\label{sec:lp-qp}

In our learning setup, the best comparison function is the one with
maximum margin. We will define the margin in two different ways, which
correspond to the linear program (LP) and quadratic program (QP)
discussed below. To illustrate the differences between these
max-margin comparison problems, in this section we assume that the
training data are linearly separable. Later in
Section~\ref{sec:kernelized-qp}, we propose an algorithm for learning
a nonlinear function from non-separable data.

In the following linear program, we learn a linear ranking function
$r(\mathbf x)=\mathbf w^\intercal \mathbf x$ that maximizes the margin
$\mu$, defined in terms of ranking function values. The margin $\mu$
is the smallest rank difference between a decision boundary $r(\mathbf
x)\in\{-1,1\}$ and a difference vector $r(\mathbf x_i'-\mathbf
x_i)$. The max margin LP is
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:max-margin-lp}
  \maximize_{\mu\in\RR^+, \mathbf w\in\RR^p}\ &&\hskip -0.5cm \mu \\
  \nonumber
  \text{subject to}\ && \hskip -0.5cm \mu \leq
  1-|\mathbf w^\intercal (\mathbf x_i' - \mathbf x_i)|,\ 
  \forall\  i\in \mathcal I_0,\\
  \nonumber
  &&\hskip -0.5cm
  \mu \leq -1 +  \mathbf w^\intercal(\mathbf x_i'-\mathbf x_i)y_i,
  \ \forall\ i\in \mathcal I_1\cup \mathcal I_{-1}.
\end{eqnarray}
The optimal decision boundaries $r(\mathbf x)\in\{-1,1\}$ and margin
boundaries $r(\mathbf x)\in\{-1\pm \mu, 1 \pm \mu\}$ are drawn 
in Figure~\ref{fig:hard-margin}. Note that finding a feasible point
for this LP is a test of linear separability. If there are no feasible
points then the data are not linearly separable.

Another way to formulate the comparison problem is by first performing
a change of variables, and then solving a binary SVM QP. The idea is
to maximize the margin between significant differences
$y_i\in\{-1,1\}$ and equality pairs $y_i=0$. Let $\mathbf X_y,\mathbf
X_y'$ be the $|\mathcal I_y|\times p$ matrices formed by all the pairs
$i\in \mathcal I_y$. We define a new ``flipped'' data set with
$m=|\mathcal I_1|+|\mathcal I_{-1}|+2|\mathcal I_0|$ pairs suitable
for training a binary SVM:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tilde}
\mathbf{  \tilde X} = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      \mathbf X_1 \\
      \mathbf X_{-1}'\\
      \mathbf X_0\\
      \mathbf X_0'
    \end{array}
  \right],\ 
  \mathbf{\tilde X'} = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      \mathbf X_1' \\
      \mathbf X_{-1}\\
      \mathbf X_0'\\
      \mathbf X_0
    \end{array}
  \right],\ 
  \mathbf{\tilde y} = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      \mathbf 1_{|\mathcal I_1|} \\
      \mathbf 1_{|\mathcal I_{-1}|}\\
      \mathbf{-1}_{|\mathcal I_0|}\\
      \mathbf{-1}_{|\mathcal I_0|}
    \end{array}
  \right],
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf 1_n$ is an $n$-vector of ones, $\mathbf{\tilde
  X},\mathbf{\tilde X'}\in\RR^{m\times p}$ and $\mathbf{\tilde
  y}\in\{-1,1\}^m$. Note that $\tilde y_i=-1$ implies no significant
difference between $\mathbf{\tilde x}_i$ and $\mathbf{\tilde x}_i'$,
and $\tilde y_i=1$ implies that $\mathbf{\tilde x}_i'$ is better than
$\mathbf{\tilde x}_i$. We then learn an affine function $f(\mathbf
x)=\beta+\mathbf u^\intercal \mathbf x$ using a binary SVM QP:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:max-margin-qp-tilde}
  \minimize_{\mathbf u\in\RR^p, \beta\in\RR}\ &&\hskip -0.5cm
  \mathbf u^\intercal \mathbf u  \\
\nonumber    \text{subject to}\ &&\hskip -0.5cm 
    \tilde y_i (\beta + 
    \mathbf u^\intercal( \mathbf{\tilde x}_i'-\mathbf{\tilde x}_i) ) \geq 1,
    \ \forall i\in\{1,\dots,m\}.
\end{eqnarray}
This SVM QP learns a separator $f(\mathbf x)=0$ between significant
difference pairs $\tilde y_i=1$ and insignificant difference pairs
$\tilde y_i=-1$ (middle and right panels of
Figure~\ref{fig:hard-margin}). However, we want a comparison function
that predicts $c(\mathbf x,\mathbf x')\in\{-1,0,1\}$. So we use the
next Lemma to construct a ranking function $r(\mathbf x)= \mathbf{\hat
  w}^\intercal \mathbf x$ that is feasible for the original max margin
comparison LP (\ref{eq:max-margin-lp}), and can be used with the
comparison function~$c_1$ (\ref{eq:compare_general}).
\begin{lemma}
  Let $\mathbf u\in\RR^p,\beta\in\RR$ be a solution of
  (\ref{eq:max-margin-qp-tilde}). Then $\hat \mu = -1/\beta$ and
  $\mathbf{\hat w} = -\mathbf u/\beta$ are feasible for
  (\ref{eq:max-margin-lp}).
  \label{lemma:feasible}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Begin by assuming that we want to find a ranking function $r(\mathbf
  x)=\mathbf{\hat w}^\intercal \mathbf x = \gamma \mathbf u^\intercal
  \mathbf x$, where $\gamma\in\RR$ is a scaling constant. Then
  consider that for all $\mathbf x$ on the decision boundary, we have
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dec-boundary-rank}
    r(\mathbf x) = \mathbf{\hat w}^\intercal \mathbf x = 1\text{ and } 
    f(\mathbf x) = \mathbf u^\intercal \mathbf x + \beta = 0.
  \end{equation}
  Taken together, it is clear that $\gamma=-1/\beta$ and thus
  $\mathbf{\hat w} = -\mathbf u/\beta$. Consider for all $\mathbf x$ on the
  margin we have
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:margin-rank}
    r(\mathbf x) = \mathbf{\hat w}^\intercal \mathbf x = 1+\hat\mu\text{ and } 
    f(\mathbf x) = \mathbf u^\intercal \mathbf x + \beta= 1.
  \end{equation}
  Taken together, these imply $\hat \mu=-1/\beta$. Now, by definition
  of the flipped data (\ref{eq:tilde}), we can re-write the max margin
  QP (\ref{eq:max-margin-qp-tilde}) as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:max-margin-qp}
    \minimize_{\mathbf u\in\RR^p, \beta\in\RR}\ &&
    \hskip -0.5cm \mathbf u^\intercal \mathbf u  \\
    \text{subject to}\ &&\hskip -0.5cm
    \nonumber \beta + |\mathbf u^\intercal (\mathbf x_i'-\mathbf x_i)| \leq -1,\
    \forall\  i\in \mathcal I_0,\\
    &&\hskip -0.5cm
\nonumber \beta + \mathbf u^\intercal(\mathbf x_i'-\mathbf x_i)y_i \geq 1,
\ \forall\ i \in \mathcal I_1\cup \mathcal I_{-1}.
\end{eqnarray}
By re-writing the constraints of (\ref{eq:max-margin-qp}) in terms of
$\hat \mu$ and $\mathbf{\hat w}$, we recover the same constraints as
the max margin comparison LP (\ref{eq:max-margin-lp}). Thus $\hat \mu,
\mathbf{\hat w}$ are feasible for (\ref{eq:max-margin-lp}).
\end{proof}

One may also wonder: are $\hat \mu,\mathbf{\hat w}$ optimal for the
max margin comparison LP? In general, the answer is no, and we give
one counterexample in the middle panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:hard-margin}. This is because the LP defines the
margin in terms of ranking function values $r(\mathbf x)=\mathbf
w^\intercal \mathbf x$, but the QP defines the margin in terms of the
size of the normal vector $||\mathbf u||$, which depends on the scale
of the inputs $\mathbf x,\mathbf x'$. However, when the input
variables are scaled in a pre-processing step, we have observed that
the solutions to the LP and QP are equivalent (right panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:hard-margin}).

Lemma~\ref{lemma:feasible} establishes the fact that one can learn a
ranking function $r$ and a corresponding comparison function $c_1$
(\ref{eq:compare_general}) by solving either the LP
(\ref{eq:max-margin-lp}) or the QP (\ref{eq:max-margin-qp}). To make
corresponding learning problems for non-separable data, one can add
slack variables to either the QP or the LP. In the next section, we
pursue only the QP, since it leads to a dual problem with a sparse
solution that can be solved by any standard SVM solver such as libsvm
\citep{libsvm}.

\subsection{Kernelized QP for non-separable data}
\label{sec:kernelized-qp}
In this section, we assume the data are not separable, and want to
learn a nonlinear ranking function. We define a positive definite
kernel $\kappa:\RR^p\times \RR^p\rightarrow\RR$, which implicitly
defines an enlarged set of features $\Phi(\mathbf x)$ (middle panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:norm-data}). As in (\ref{eq:max-margin-qp-tilde}), we
learn a function $f(\mathbf x)=\beta + \mathbf u^\intercal
\Phi(\mathbf x)$ which is affine in the feature space. Let $\mathbf
\alpha,\mathbf \alpha'\in\RR^m$ be coefficients such that $\mathbf
u=\sum_{i=1}^m
\alpha_i \Phi(\mathbf{\tilde x}_i) + 
\alpha_i' \Phi(\mathbf{\tilde x}_i')$, and so we have
 $f(\mathbf x) =\beta + \sum_{i=1}^m 
 \alpha_i \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_i, \mathbf x) +
 \alpha_i' \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_i', \mathbf x)$. 
 We then use Lemma~\ref{lemma:feasible} to
define the ranking function
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:kernelized_r}
  r(\mathbf x)= \frac{\mathbf u^\intercal \Phi(\mathbf x)}{-\beta} = 
  \sum_{i=1}^m
  \frac{
    \alpha_i \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_i, \mathbf x) +
    \alpha_i'  \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_i', \mathbf x)}
{-\beta}.
\end{equation}

\end{algorithm}

Let $\mathbf K=[
\mathbf k_1\cdots \mathbf k_m
\ \mathbf k_1'\cdots \mathbf k_m']\in\RR^{2m\times 2m}$ be the
kernel matrix, where for all pairs $i\in\{1, \dots, m\}$, the kernel
vectors $\mathbf k_i,\mathbf k_i'\in\RR^{2m}$ are defined as
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf k_i = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_1, \mathbf{\tilde x}_i)\\
      \vdots\\
      \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_m, \mathbf{\tilde x}_i)\\
      \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_1', \mathbf{\tilde x}_i)\\
      \vdots\\
      \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_m', \mathbf{\tilde x}_i)
    \end{array}
  \right],\ 
  \mathbf k_i' = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_1, \mathbf{\tilde x}_i')\\
      \vdots\\
      \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_m, \mathbf{\tilde x}_i')\\
      \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_1', \mathbf{\tilde x}_i')\\
      \vdots\\
      \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_m', \mathbf{\tilde x}_i')
    \end{array}
  \right].
\end{equation}
Letting $\mathbf a=[\alpha^\intercal\
\alpha'^\intercal]^\intercal\in\RR^{2m}$, the norm of the affine
function $f$ in the feature space is $\mathbf u^\intercal \mathbf u =
\mathbf a^\intercal \mathbf K \mathbf a$, and we can write the primal soft-margin
comparison QP for some $C\in\RR^+$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \minimize_{\mathbf a\in\RR^{2m},\mathbf \xi\in\RR^m,\beta\in\RR}\ \ &&\hskip -0.5cm 
  \frac 1 2 \mathbf a^\intercal \mathbf K \mathbf a + C\sum_{i=1}^m \xi_i \\
  \text{subject to}\ \ &&\hskip -0.5cm \nonumber
  \text{for all $i\in\{1,\dots,m\}$, }
  \xi_i \geq 0,\\
  &&\hskip -0.5cm \nonumber \text{and }
  \xi_i \geq 1-\tilde y_i(\beta + \mathbf a^\intercal (\mathbf k_i'-\mathbf k_i)).
\end{eqnarray}
Let $\mathbf z, \mathbf v\in\RR^m$ be the dual variables, and
$\mathbf Y=\Diag(\mathbf{\tilde y})$ be the diagonal matrix of $m$
labels. Then the Lagrangian can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lagrangian}
  \mathcal L = \frac 1 2 \mathbf a^\intercal \mathbf K \mathbf a + 
  C\mathbf \xi^\intercal\mathbf  1_{m}\\
  -\mathbf z^\intercal \mathbf \xi
  + \mathbf v^\intercal(\mathbf 1_m - \mathbf{\tilde y}\beta
  - \mathbf Y \mathbf M^\intercal \mathbf K\mathbf  a - \xi),
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf M=[-\mathbf I_m \, \mathbf
I_m]^\intercal\in\{-1,0,1\}^{2m\times m}$ and $\mathbf I_m$ is the
identity matrix. Solving $\nabla_{\mathbf a} \mathcal L=0$ results in
the following stationary condition:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:stationarity}
  \mathbf a = \mathbf M \mathbf Y \mathbf v.
\end{equation}
The rest of the derivation of the dual comparison problem is the same
as for the standard binary SVM. The resulting dual QP is
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:svm-dual}
    \minimize_{\mathbf v\in\RR^m}\ \ &
    \frac 1 2 \mathbf v^\intercal \mathbf Y \mathbf M^\intercal 
    \mathbf K \mathbf M \mathbf Y \mathbf v - \mathbf v^\intercal \mathbf 1_m\\
    \text{subject to}\ \ &
    \sum_{i=1}^m v_i \tilde y_i = 0,\\
    & \text{for all $i\in\{1,\dots,m\}$, } 0\leq v_i\leq C,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to the dual problem of a standard binary SVM with
kernel $\mathbf{\tilde K} = \mathbf M^\intercal \mathbf K \mathbf
M\in\RR^{m\times m}$ and labels $\mathbf{\tilde y}\in\{-1,1\}^m$.

So we can solve the dual comparison problem (\ref{eq:svm-dual}) using
any efficient SVM solver, such as libsvm \citep{libsvm}. We used the R
interface in the \texttt{kernlab} package \citep{kernlab}, and our
code is available in the \texttt{rankSVMcompare} package on Github.

After obtaining optimal dual variables $\mathbf v\in\RR^m$ as the solution of
(\ref{eq:svm-dual}), the SVM solver also gives us the optimal bias
$\beta$ by analyzing the complementary slackness conditions.
The learned ranking function can be quickly evaluated since the
optimal $\mathbf v$ is sparse. Let $\sv =\{i: v_i > 0\}$ be the indices
of the support vectors. Since we need only $2|\sv |$ kernel
evaluations, the ranking function (\ref{eq:kernelized_r}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:r_sv}
  r(\mathbf x)= 
  \sum_{i\in \sv }
  \tilde y_i v_i\left[ 
    \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_i, \mathbf x)
    - \kappa(\mathbf{\tilde x}_i', \mathbf x)
  \right]/\beta.
\end{equation}
Note that for all $i\in\{1,\dots,m\}$, the optimal primal variables
$\alpha_i=-\tilde y_i v_i$ and $\alpha_i'=\tilde y_i v_i$ are
recovered using the stationary condition (\ref{eq:stationarity}). The
learned comparison function $c_1$ remains the same (\ref{eq:compare_general}).

The training procedure is summarized as
Algorithm~\ref{alg:SVMcompare}, SVMcompare.
There are two sub-routines: \proc{KernelMatrix} computes
the $2m\times 2m$ kernel matrix, and \proc{SVMdual} solves the SVM
dual QP (\ref{eq:svm-dual}). There are two hyper-parameters to tune:
the cost $C$ and the kernel $\kappa$. As with standard SVM for binary
classification, these parameters can be tuned by minimizing the
prediction error on a held-out validation set.

\end{table}

The goal of learning to compare is to accurately predict a test set of
labeled pairs (\ref{eq:min_c}), which includes equality $y_i=0$
pairs. We test the SVMcompare algorithm alongside two baseline models
that use SVMrank \citep{ranksvm}. We chose SVMrank as a baseline
because of its similar large-margin learning formulation, to
demonstrate the importance of directly modeling the equality $y_i=0$
pairs. SVMrank does not directly model the equality $y_i=0$ pairs, so
we expect that the proposed SVMcompare algorithm makes better
predictions when these data are present. The differences between the
algorithms are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:models}:

\begin{description}
\item[rank] is described in Section~\ref{sec:svmrank}: first we use
  $|\mathcal I_1|+|\mathcal I_{-1}|$ inequality pairs to learn
  SVMrank, then we use all $n$ pairs to learn a threshold $\hat \tau$
  for when to predict $c(\mathbf x,\mathbf x')=0$.
\item[rank2] is another variant of SVMrank that treats each input pair
  as 2 inequality pairs. Since SVMrank can only use inequality pairs,
  we transform each equality pair $(\mathbf x_i,\mathbf x_i',0)$ into two
  opposite-facing inequality pairs $(\mathbf x_i',\mathbf x_i,1)$ and
  $(\mathbf x_i,\mathbf x_i',1)$. 
  To ensure equal weight for all input pairs in the
  cost function, we also duplicate each inequality pair, resulting in
  $2n$ pairs used to train SVMrank.
\item[compare] is the SVMcompare model proposed in this paper, which
  uses $m=n+|\mathcal I_0|$ input pairs.
\end{description}

For each experiment, there are train, validation, and test sets each
drawn from the same set of examples. We fit a $10\times 10$ grid of
models to the training set (cost parameter $C=10^{-3},\dots,10^3$,
Gaussian kernel width $2^{-7},\dots,2^4$), and select the model using
the validation set. We use two evaluation metrics to judge the
performance of the models: zero-one loss and area under the ROC curve
(AUC).

Note that the ROC curves are calculated by first evaluating the
learned ranking function $r(\mathbf x)$ at each test point $\mathbf
x$, and then varying the threshold $\tau$ of the comparison function
$c_\tau$ (\ref{eq:compare_general}). For $\tau=0$ we have 100\% false
positive rate and for $\tau=\infty$ we have 100\% false negative rate
(Table~\ref{tab:evaluation}).

\subsection{Simulation: squared norms in 2D}
\label{sec:simulations}

We used a simulation to visualize the learned nonlinear ranking
functions in a $p=2$ dimensional feature space. We generated pairs
$\mathbf x_i,\mathbf x_i'\in[-3,3]^2$ and noisy labels
$y_i=t_1[r(\mathbf x'_i)-r(\mathbf x_i)+\epsilon_i]$, where $t_1$ is
the threshold function (\ref{eq:threshold}), $r$ is the latent ranking
function, $\epsilon_i\sim N(0, \sigma)$ is noise, and $\sigma=1/4$ is
the standard deviation. We picked train, validation, and test sets,
each with the same number of pairs $n$ and the same proportion $\rho$
of equality pairs. We selected the model with minimum zero-one loss on
the validation set.

In Figure~\ref{fig:norm-level-curves} we defined the true ranking
function $r(\mathbf x)=||\mathbf x||_1^2$, then picked $n=100$ pairs,
with $\rho=1/2$ equality and inequality pairs. We show the training
set and the level curves of the ranking functions learned by the
SVMrank and SVMcompare models. It is clear that the true ranking
function $r$ is not accurately recovered by the rank model, since it
does not use the equality $y_i=0$ pairs. In contrast, the compare and
rank2 methods which exploit the equality $y_i=0$ pairs are able to
recover a ranking function that is closer to the true $r$.

We also used the simulations to demonstrate that our model can achieve
lower test error than the baseline SVMrank model, by learning from the
equality $y_i=0$ pairs. In Figure~\ref{fig:simulation-samples} we
fixed the proportion of equality pairs $\rho=1/2$, varied the number
of training pairs $n\in\{50,\dots, 800\}$, and tested three simulated
ranking functions $r(\mathbf x)=||\mathbf x||^2_j$ for
$j\in\{1,2,\infty\}$. In general, the test error of all models
decreases as training set size $n$ increases. The model with the
highest test error is the rank model, which does not use the equality
$y_i=0$ pairs. The next best model is the rank2 model, which converts
the equality $y_i=0$ pairs to inequality pairs and then trains
SVMrank. The best model is the proposed SVMcompare model, which
achieves test error as good as the true ranking function in the case
of $r(\mathbf x)=||\mathbf x||^2_2$.

    points of equal rank), and half inequality (arrows point to the

    error as a function of data set size $n$ (a vertical line
    shows the data set which was used in
    Figure~\ref{fig:norm-level-curves}). Lines show mean and shaded

    picked $n=400$ pairs, varying the proportion $\rho$ of equality
    pairs. We plot mean and standard deviation of AUC over 4 test
    sets.}
  \label{fig:auc}
\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:auc} we fixed the number of training pairs $n=400$
and varied the proportion $\rho$ of equality pairs for the three
simulated squared norm ranking functions $r$. We select the model with
maximum area under the validation set ROC curve, then use test set AUC
to evaluate the learned models. All methods perform close to the
optimal true ranking function when $r(\mathbf x)=||\mathbf
x||^2_2$. For the other patterns, it is clear that all the methods
perform similarly when there are mostly inequality pairs ($\rho=0.1$),
since SVMrank was designed for this type of training data. In
contrast, when there are mostly equality pairs ($\rho=0.9$), the
compare and rank2 methods clearly outperform the rank method, which
ignores the equality pairs. \changed{It is also clear that the rank2 and
compare methods perform similarly in terms of test AUC.}

\changed{Overall from the simulations, it is clear that when the data contain
equality pairs, it is advantageous to use a model such as the proposed
SVMcompare method which learns from them directly as a part of the
optimization problem.}

\subsection{Learning to rank sushi data}

We downloaded the sushi data set of \citet{object-ranking-methods}
from \texttt{http://www.kamishima.net/sushi/}. We used the
\texttt{sushi3b.5000.10.score} data, which consist of 100 different
sushis rated by 5000 different people. Each person rated 10 sushis on
a 5 point scale, which we convert to 5 preference pairs, for a total
of 17,832 equality $y_i=0$ and 7,168 inequality $y_i\in\{-1,1\}$
pairs. For each pair $i$ we have features $\mathbf x_i,\mathbf
x_i'\in\RR^{14}$ consisting of 7 features of the sushi and 7 features
of the person. Sushi features are style, major, minor, oily, eating
frequency, price, and selling frequency. Person features are gender, age,
time, birthplace and current home (we converted Japanese prefecture
codes to latitude/longitude coordinates).

As in the simulations of Section~\ref{sec:simulations}, we picked
train, validation, and test sets, each with the same number of pairs
$n$ and the same proportion $\rho$ of equality pairs. We fit a grid of
models to the training set, select the model with
minimal zero-one loss on the validation set, and then use the test set
to estimate the generalization ability of the selected model.

In Figure~\ref{fig:simulation-samples} we fixed the proportion of
equality pairs $\rho=1/2$, varied the number of training pairs
$n\in\{50,\dots, 800\}$, and calculated test error. The relative
performance of the algorithms is the same as in the simulations: rank
has the highest test error, rank2 does better, and the proposed
SVMcompare algorithm has the lowest test error.

In Figure~\ref{fig:auc} we fixed the number of training pairs $n=400$,
varied the proportion $\rho$ of equality pairs, and calculated test
AUC. \changed{Like in the $r(\mathbf x)=||\mathbf x||_2^2$ simulation,
  test AUC is about the same for each of the models
  considered. Perhaps this is because they are all able to learn a
  nearly optimal ranking function for this problem.}

\changed{Overall from the sushi data, it is clear that the proposed SVMcompare
model performs better than the SVMrank methods in terms of test error,
and it performs as well as the SVMrank methods in terms of test AUC.

\subsection{SVMcompare predict outcomes of chess games more accurately than ELO}

In this section, we show that our SVMcompare algorithm can be used for
highly accurate prediction of the outcome of chess matches. Chess is a
game between 2 players that results in a win, loss or a draw, with the
most common outcome between highly ranked players in international
tournaments being a draw. We wished to predict outcomes of tournament
chess matches by learning a comparison function using features based
on player statistics.  The main statistic to quantify player rankings
in FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs) competitions is the ELO
score.  The ELO rating system is a method for calculating relative
skill levels of players in competitor versus competitor games was
intially proposed by \citet{elo_score}.
% Given two player's ratings the probability of win and loss for each can
% be computed.  
The Glicko rating system 
provides a more complex alternative \citep{GLICKO}.

We downloaded the chess match dataset from Chessmetrics, containing
1.8 million games played over the 11-year period from 1999-2009 by
54205 chess players.  For each of the years 1999-2006, we consider the
first four months (Jan-Apr) as a train set, and the last eight months
as a test set (May-Dec). 
We
removed all matches containing a player who had less than 10 matches
against other players in the train set, to prevent our data set from
containing players with very little information.  We also removed all
matches that contained a players first match from the train set as we
would have no information about this player.
For each match $i$, we computed features
$\mathbf x_i,\mathbf x_i'\in\RR^{16}$ consisting of ELO
scores, Glicko scores, if the player had the initial move, the
percentage of instances where a player either lost to a lower ranked
player, or won against a higher ranked player, the average score
difference of opponents, win/loss/draw/games played raw values and
percentages in addition to various other statistics. ELO scores were
initially set at 1200 for all players and FIDE rules were applied to
score calculations.  ELO and Glicko scores were updated after every
match using the PlayerRatings R package  \citep{play-raitings}.  

For hyper parameter selection, we used the first 3 months of each 12-month period.  We preformed cross validation splits of the first  $\{0.50,0.75,0.80,0.85\}$ matches in the set as our training set and the remainder as the validation set.  We fit a grid of models for each linear, polynomial and gaussian kernel to the training set to select a model with the maximum AUC on the validation set.  We then tested these models using the first 4 months of each 12-month period as a training set and the next 8 months as the testing set and computed the AUC for each of the 8 periods.  We also preformed hyper parameter selection and testing using the same method for datasets containing only ELO and Glicko features.

We then computed AUC values using either the ELO or Glicko scores only on the same 4 month/8 month train/test splits.  As shown in Figure 6, the median for the linear and polynomial SVM kernels preforms better than benchmark ELO and Glicko scoring systems.  Additionally, linear and polynomial SVM models using only ELO and Glicko features preform worse than using only ELO scores for predictions.  This suggests that additional features computed in our model were relevant in learning models that preformed better than ELO scores.

Overall, given chess match data, it is clear that the proposed SVMcompare model preforms better than using probabilities generated from FIDE ELO scores in prediction of chess match outcomes.

\section{Conclusions and future work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We discussed the learning to compare problem, which has not yet been
extensively studied in the machine learning literature. In
Section~\ref{sec:lp-qp}, we proposed two different formulations for
max-margin comparison, and proved their relationship in
Lemma~\ref{lemma:feasible}. It justifies our proposed SVMcompare
algorithm, which uses a binary SVM dual QP solver to learn a nonlinear
comparison function. \changed{In future work it will be interesting to explore
the learning capability of a kernelized version of the LP
(\ref{eq:max-margin-lp}) with slack variables added to the objective
function.}

Our experimental results on simulated and real data clearly showed the
importance of directly modeling the equality pairs, when they are
present. We showed in Figure~\ref{fig:auc} that when there are few
equality pairs, as is the usual setup in learning to rank problems,
the baseline SVMrank algorithm performs as well as our proposed
SVMcompare algorithm. However, when there are many equality pairs, it
is clearly advantageous to use a model such as SVMcompare which
directly learns from the equality pairs.

Out results also indicate that the proposed model preforms better when determining outcomes of chess matches than the current FIDE ELO player ranking system and that incorporating additional features into out model gives an increase in accuracy.

For future work, it will be interesting to see if the same results are
observed in learning to rank data from search engines. For scaling to
these very large data sets, we would like to try algorithms based on
smooth discriminative loss functions, such as stochastic gradient
descent with a logistic loss.
